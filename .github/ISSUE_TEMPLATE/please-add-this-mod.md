Why this form?

So you have a suggestion for the addition of a mod? Great! I am glad to hear it. This is the form to use. Please use one form per mod that you want to see added. Please also state why it should be added. Be prepared to defend yourself against the others who might disagree with you.

The data collected from this form and others like it will be used to create a custom poll to determine which mods will be added during the upcoming pack rebuild phase that occurs after the diet phase.
